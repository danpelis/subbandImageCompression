# subbandImageCompression
CPE 462 Final Project

The goal of this project was to test the effects of subband image compression on a test image. Different quatization levels and wavelets can be specified. 

__To Run the Scipt:__
  1. Clone this repo
  2. Open Matlab and navigate to this project's directory
  3. Enter `subbandEncoder` into the command window
  4. You will be prompted for desired quantization level and wavelet
  
  *As of right now the script does not work with png files. It works best with jpg files*
